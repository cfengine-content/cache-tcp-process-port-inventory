#+Title: Cache TCP process and port inventory

By default CFEngine Enterprise inventories ports that are listening. This works
as long as =cf-monitord= is running.

This policy caches inventory data to
=$(cached_inventory_load.cachedir)/module_protocol/cache_tcp_process_port_inventory.cache=
for listening TCP ports and the associated process. It requires
[[https://github.com/cfengine-content/cached_inventory][cfengine_content:cached_inventory]] for reporting cached values. This policy does
not require =cf-monitord= in order to work.

** Configure cache retention

The default cache retention is 1 day. To override this define
=def.cache_tcp_process_port_inventory=.

Example Augments:

- Include this policy in inputs
- Include [[https://github.com/cfengine-content/cached_inventory][cfengine_content:cached_inventory]] in inputs
- Add this policy and [[https://github.com/cfengine-content/cached_inventory][cfengine_content:cached_inventory]] to bundlesequence
- Override this policies cache retention setting it to 1 minute
